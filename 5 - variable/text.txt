variable 
     
     it is like a container to store value and use it later

syntax 
    
    1. let  - create new variable
    2. variable name 
    3. = 
    4. value
   
   like 
       
        let variable = 3;

        variable initialize short cut 
              
              variable++'

Best practice for naming a variable is the 
     
     1. it should short 
     2. not too simple like "c" and too long 

Naming convertion
   
     camelCase   cartQuatity

     PascalCase  CartQuatity

     Kebab-case  cart-quantity

     snake_case  cart_quantity


3 ways to create variable 
    
    let   - it is the best pracitce is to declare the variable

    var   - var has some issues

    const - can't change the variable further once it is initialize
           
           best pracitce = use const by default 
           (only use let when we need to change the variable)




typeof 
   
   it is used to find the type of the variable are we used


eval 
   
   it is the function used to convert the calculation string into actual math.
