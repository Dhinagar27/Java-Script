Syntax Rules for numbers and math
      
      10 / 2
      10 * 3

it will also accept the decimal numbers

    order of operations 
       
       +   
       -
       *
       / 
         
    (operator precednece)

       ()

       * / are done first
  
       - + are done after

          if the same priority operator come together it will solve (left to right)
    
    Syntax Rules for Brackets
       
       ( ) must be in this format


1.weird behavior of math in javaScript
     
     in programing
         
         2,3,4 are integers
         2.2,2.3 are float
     

  when calculating money 
  we want to avoid any inaccuacies 
         
         best practice is to 
            1. calculate in cents instead of dollars
            2. bact to original format

         like if ( 20.95 + 7.99) gives 28.9399999999998 
                       
               we want 28.94
               
               so use (2095 + 799) / 100 give the answer
                   28.94

  2. rounding a number

       Math.round(2.2)  


In this lesson 

1. Numbers and Math 
2. Order of Operations, and Brackets
3. Calculated the numbers in final project 
4. Calculations using floats can be inaccurate 
5. Math.round()
