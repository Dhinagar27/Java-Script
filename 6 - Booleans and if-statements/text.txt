Boolean and if statements

      there only 2 boolean values:
          true and false
      
      Syntax for Booleans
           
           if we want to use  Boolean use like this  true or false not like this 'true' and 'false':

Comparison Operators 

       > Greater than 

       < Less than 

       >= Greater than or equal to 

       <= Less than or equal to

       === equal to  
            
            == try to convert both the variable into same type

       !== not equal to 

  order of operations 
       
       1. (.....)

       2. * / 

       3. + - 
       
       4. Comparision operators

if - statements
    
    lets us write multiple groups of code 
    and then decide which code to run

  Syntax 
     
     if(condition)
     {
      statements 
     }
     else
     {
      statements
     }

Rock paper scissors
   
   algorithm
   
when we click a button:
    
1. computer randomly selects a move 
2. compare the moves to get the result
3. display the result in a popup 
   

   Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1

logical operators
   
   && 
   ||


Truthy value and falsy value 
     
    ( false, 0 ,'', NaN ,undefinded, null )are the falsy value

    other then falsy value are called trythy value

In this lesson 

     1. Boolean values(true , false)
     2. if - statements
     3. comparison operators(>,<.....)
        logical operators(&&,||)
     4. algorithm, and created Rock paper scissors
     5. Truthy and Falsy values
     6. Shortcut like Guard , default , ternary operators
